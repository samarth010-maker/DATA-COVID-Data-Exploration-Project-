#COVID Data Exploration Project
Description
This project aims to explore and analyze COVID-19 data, focusing on both COVID deaths and vaccination statistics. It utilizes datasets containing information on COVID deaths (CovidDeaths) and COVID vaccinations (CovidVaccination). By querying these datasets using SQL, various analyses are performed to gain insights into the impact of COVID-19 across different regions and over time.

#Installation Instructions
Ensure you have access to a SQL database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.
Load the provided datasets (CovidDeaths and CovidVaccination) into your SQL database.
Clone or download the project files from the repository.

#Usage
Execute SQL queries against the datasets to perform various analyses. Example queries are provided in the project files.
Explore relationships between COVID cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population demographics.
Visualize key findings using your preferred data visualization tools or platforms.

#Data Sources
CovidDeaths Dataset: Contains information about COVID-related deaths, including location, date, total cases, total deaths, and population.
CovidVaccination Dataset: Provides data on COVID vaccination progress, including location, date, and new vaccinations.

#Data Exploration
Analyze total cases vs. total deaths.
Calculate the percentage of population infected by COVID.
Identify countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
Explore countries with the highest death counts per population.
Investigate global COVID trends over time.

#Results
Identified countries with significant COVID outbreaks.
Explored vaccination progress relative to population size.
Detected trends in COVID cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.

#Future Work
Incorporate additional datasets to enrich analysis (e.g., economic indicators, healthcare capacity).
Develop more advanced visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
Explore predictive modeling to forecast COVID trends and inform public health strategies.
